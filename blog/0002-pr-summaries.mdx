# Pull Request Summaries

When you move quick, it can be hard to keep track of everything that's been
merged. Void can now automatically send a list of merged pull requests directly
to Slack.

## Why it's good

- no more copy-pasting commits
- see all repos at once
- grouped by contributors

## Configure how often to send them

Go into Settings > Pull Request Summaries to set how often to receive them.
