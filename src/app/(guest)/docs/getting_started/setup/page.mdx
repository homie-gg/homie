# Setup

<Description>
  Before Homie can start tracking your project, youâ€™ll need to install the Homie
  application to GitHub (or Gitlab), and Slack.
</Description>

## 1. Install GitHub or Gitlab App

Homie will use the app install to track Pull Requests, and generate summaries.

### GitHub

Click the GitHub button to be redirected to the GitHub app install screen.

Select the GitHub Organization that you'd like to install Homie to:

Select the repositories you'd like to track, or just track everything by leaving it as 'All repositories':

![Select GitHub Repositories](/docs/getting-started/setup/github-select-repositories.png)

Finally, click Install, and you're done!

### Gitlab

Select Gitlab by clicking the Install Gitlab button. You'll then be asked to authorize Homie to use your account:

**Selecting projects**

Gitlab requires you to select which Projects you'd like Homie to track. By
default, Homie won't track any projects.

To track projects, go into **Settings > Gitlab**, and select the projects that you'd like Homie to track.

### Note on Code Security

<Alert>
Homie will never push code to your repository, and does not store your code.
Only summaries, and snippets. This is to comply with our own strict security
practices to make sure user code is never leaked, by not storing them in the
first place. Feel free to read more about our security best practices here.
</Alert>

### 2. Install Slack App

Slack is where you'll chat with Homie. You can send messages, receive reports, and
trigger manual actions. To do all that, we need to install the Homie app to
your team's Slack workspace.

Click the install Slack button to get started.

![Install slack button](/docs/getting-started/setup/slack-install-button.png)

Then, select your workspace on the top-right, as well as a Slack channel that Homie will be able to messages to.

To add Homie to other channels, simply mention @Homie, and follow the Slack
prompt to invite him to each channel.

<Alert>
Homie can reply to messages in _any_ channel, but can only initiate messages in the channel selected above.
